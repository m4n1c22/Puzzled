Longest run of heads in a sequence of coin tosses
A coin is tossed n times, thereby generating a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T). A subsequence of
consecutive heads is called a run of heads. Consequently, the following sequence
HHTHTTHHHHTTTHHTTTTH
of length n = 20 contains 5 runs of heads with lengths 2,1,4,2,1, respectively. The longest run of heads is
Mn = 4.
a) Write a function (in R or Matlab) which generates random sequences of heads and tails for any value
of n.
b) Write a function which computes the length of the longest run of heads in an arbitrary sequence of
heads and tails.
c) For a sequence of length n = 1000, we have observed a longest run of heads equal to Mn = 6.
Basing your decision on this piece of information, do you believe that the coin is fair or not?
